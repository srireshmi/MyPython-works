# MyPython-works
My course work in Python programming covered basic programming concepts and Python syntax. It then continued to deepen my knowledge of Python by understanding how to access data (text files, databases and other data storage technologies), and process and manipulate that data. Basics of creating front-end interfaces with Python are covered in this course allowed me to produce more intuitive interaction with application users. Beyond core Python libraries, other commonly used Python libraries are also utilized in the course. This course focused on good programming practices and solving problems effectively. At the successful completion of the class, I was able to create a number of different types of projects and execute them in Python, as well as still learning and applying Python skills to data analytics, GIS and other areas of my interest.
